# Stupid App Ideas

A list of stupid ideas of applications. These are just meant to at least act as proof-of-concept for the frontend 
backend core code.


## SnackChat

A social media application. It allows you to chat with your friends but using only media (images/videos) of snacks.
Creators (or snackers) can post content of their favorite snacks. A post can contain a number of "SnackTags". A SnackTag
is an emoji in the food/drinks category.

A snacker can follow other snackers for content. This content is displayed in a central feed.
